Many of the web software developments are started more than a decade ago.
At that time developer made software on 800x600 or 1024x768 screen monitor, itâ€™s not only small by today screen standard but also most screen ratio at that time is 4:3, so developer made two columns layout, navigation on the left and content on the right.

Today we have big and wider screen monitor, but the amount of lights from big screen tend to make our eyes in unhealthy condition.
- We need darker content and layout for our eyes health.
- Popular screen monitors are now on landscape (16:9 aspect ratio) means we need additional column. At least 3, for the navigation, the content and for the content's detail.
- We are now more connected, user demand to continue their desktop job on their mobile phone. We need responsive UI.
- Current PHP version is now PHP 7.3 and PHP is 8 coming soon. Most web softwares are made on PHP 4 released 15 years ago. Now only private server still keep running old PHP version.
- Many softwares ridiculously still using mysql prefix function, which is absolete in PHP 5.5 on 2013.
- Development need to be more open for everyone. Modules should be easy to be made with basic knowlegde of SQL query.
